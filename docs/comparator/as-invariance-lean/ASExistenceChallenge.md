# A/S existence in the invariance package

Read the companion existence target beside the invariance result. This package selects full_state_invariance in its Comparator configuration. The matching existence proof is also present in its source.

## Can the A/S model follow two different paths from the same start?

`full_existence_uniqueness`

**Proof request**

Construct an integral solution from the admissible data and prove that any other solution agrees with it on [a,b].

**Reading the result**

With admissible parameters, regular admissible inputs and a valid initial state, the proof constructs one integral solution and shows every other one agrees on the specified interval.
